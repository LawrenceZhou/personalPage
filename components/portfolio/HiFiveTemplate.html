<div class = "projectParagraph">Many people who want to get out and make friends canâ€™t bring themselves to do so, as they are too shy or socially awkward. They end up using the internet as a crutch, even though they would prefer to interact in person. We point these people to nearby projects (started by other people) that match their weirdest interests, because if you know that somebody nearby shares a rare interest or passion with you, you will want to talk to them no matter how shy you are.

Find people with common interests/goals, and ward off their direct attention: Lonely person is forlornly looking at online pictures of people having a great time with friends. The person is summoned to join two people he has never met in person.
<br><br>
Find a way to approach new companions: App sets up game. Lonely person and friends all travel around campus, doing fun Mario-Party-esque challenges. After discovering their common interest (music), they play instruments together.
<br><br>
Make new friends: The three friends talk and laugh at a table. Two of them get up and start walking down a path into the sunset, and spontaneously start holding hands.
