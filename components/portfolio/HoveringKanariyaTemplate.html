<div class = "projectParagraph">It is always the trend that drivers need better and more immersive entertainment system. More interactions between the driver and the car is one of the best ways to achieve a more satisfactory entertainment system. This project will focus on the motions of a car on-road with the sound effects of the music in the cabinet. The cabinet of a car is a confined space, which is suitable for the 360 degree sound system. This sound system will reduce the boredom of the driver, which will result in the less likeliness of accidents. Adding effects to the music will make it changeful, which can have effects on arousal and save drivers from fatigue. In addition, autonomous vehicle is on its way to release commuters from boring daily commute. Passengers do not need to focus on the road and stick their hands on the steering wheel. This system in autonomous car will reduce the unfaithfulness of the passengers as it will offer a more attractiveness which will shift the passengers focus from the on-road condition. In contrast, this sound system can also inform the passengers in an autonomous car of the conditions on the road without their need of looking out.</div>

<div class = "projectParagraph">The mapping of car motions and sound effects versus music can be used as an advanced way of interaction between drivers and the cars, which will provide a better entertainment experience to reduce the boredom of the driver, save drivers from fatigue, and reduce the unfaithfulness of the passengers in an autonomous car.</div>
