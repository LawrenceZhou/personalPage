<div class = "projectParagraph">Deep breathing can transform the car commute from a mindless experience into a calm and mindful experience for drivers of manual and autonomous vehicles. Calmmuter is a first-of-its-kind guided deep breathing intervention for commuters. A controlled experiment (N=24) is performed to examine guided interventions using haptics or voice across two factors: driving mode (manual versus autonomous) and driving environment (highway versus city). Breathing rate reduction in all conditions is successfully obtained. People found it simple to disengage and reengage from the interventions, as needed. People also liked the fact that the system "guided" them by maintaining a pace, as opposed to just reminding them to perform breathing. In autonomous situations, in addition to causing relaxation, breathing may be also explored as a way to induce attention. This intervention, the first of its kind, has huge promise to support and help millions of people that commute every day by car to transform their commute into one that relieves rather than causes stress. Calmmuter is a cutting-edge of breathing interaction for drivers and commuters.</div>

<div class = "projectSubsectitle">Haptic Guidance System</div>
<div class = "projectParagraph">The haptic guidance system was developed in our lab. Forty-one linear resonant actuators (50dB, 13000+/-3000 RPM, 2-3.6V) arranged in a grid (3" horizontal spacing and 4" vertical spacing to guarantee a clear two-point discrimination) were integrated into the back-rest of the driver’s seat covering an area of about 20" x 26". An upward vibration pattern signals 'breathing-in', no-vibrations signals 'hold breath', and a downward vibration pattern means 'breath-out'. Each up—down iteration is equivalent to a complete breathing cycle (inspiration and expiration). To design a smooth swipe pattern we used a haptic technique called Apparent Tactile Motion, which recreates the feeling of a continuous 'swipe' when adjacent motors are activated with an overlapping window of a few milliseconds.</div>
<div class = "projectSubsectitle">Voice Guidance System</div>
<div class = "projectParagraph">In one breathing cycle, the speech to text system delivered evenly two voice
commands: "Breath In" and "Breath Out". We issued voice commands delivered via concealed speakers hidden behind the simulator monitor.</div>

<div class = "projectParagraph">
Before beginning the experiment, participants answered a pre-experiment questionnaire that evaluated prior exposure to breathing technology. Then, the experimenter placed the physiological sensors (ECG, breathing rate harness, EDA bracelet) on participants body and waited until their breathing rate became steady to program the system with a rate 30% lower. The experimenter sat behind the car simulator to monitor the participant’s breathing rates. Participants were assigned to one of two Driving Modes (manual vs. autonomous). In each condition, participants drove in a Driving Environment (city vs. highway) with a breathing interaction modality (voice vs. haptic) counterbalanced across participants. Overall, each participant performed 2 interaction modality × 2 Driving Environments = 4 conditions. Following the conditions, participants answered a post-experiment questionnaire that evaluated the effectiveness and distraction generated by the guidance systems.</div>
